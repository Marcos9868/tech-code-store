# Tech Code Store

Hi guys. This is a remake of old project called tech code, that was a landing page of graphic card black friday.

I decided to take this project, using the new knowledge I acquired, to make the tech code store.

It has 3 parts, login, a home page with products coming from the database and an inventory system.

Inventory will be available only to the administrator, implementing good user authentication and authorization practices.
